### FAQ

**Q. Why ratings?**
Ratings on-chain unlock a lot of opportunities. It can serve as a verifiable proof that the user is indeed good at chess and can be used as a filter for participating in tournaments with cash prize.

**Q. Why puzzles?**
Puzzles serves a twofold purpose: assigns players ratings and helps players improve their chess. Our puzzles are not like the puzzles you find on traditional chess platforms. They are hand-picked by the best players. And are personalized by them.

**Q. What is the incentive for puzzle creators?**
After solving each puzzle, a player has the option to mint an NFT. 80% of the proceeds go to the creator of the puzzle. This way the creator is compensated for their effort and want to make the best puzzle possible.

**Q. Why would a player mint NFTs from puzzles?**
There are two reasons for it. The first one being that you are supporting the puzzle creator and you are getting a beautiful generative art NFT in return. The second reason is that the NFT is useful for unlocking access to Discord where you can find other fellow members in the same ratings as yours and play chess games with them!
